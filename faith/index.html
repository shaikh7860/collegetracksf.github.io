        Mission: Empower students from underserved communities to graduate
        from college
      </h3>
      <p>
        College Track recruits students from underserved communities and works
        continuously with them from the summer before 9th grade through
        college graduation. Our 10-year program removes the barriers that
        prevent students from earning their college degree by providing them
        with comprehensive academic support, leadership training, financial
        and college advising, and scholarships. We teach our students the
        skills necessary to succeed in college and beyond.
      </p>

      <h3>A high school diploma is not enough</h3>
      <p>
        What matters most, for young adults to build a successful future, is a
        college degree. College graduates are 2 times more likely to be
        employed and they earn 1.6 times more than high school graduates. They
        are more likely to be productive, participating members of society,
        being 2 times more likely to vote and 4.7 times more likely to
        volunteer. And yet, today, 80.5 percent of low-income students DO NOT
        graduate from college.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Over the past 18 years, College Track has demonstrated a record of
        success
      </h3>
      <p>
        Today, 93 percent of our high school students are accepted to
        four-year colleges and our college students graduate at a rate that is
        2.5 times the national average of their low-income* students. In the
        2014-2015 academic year, we served over 2,400 students across eight
        communities. We have six sites in California – East Palo Alto,
        Oakland, San Francisco, Sacramento, the Los Angeles communities of
        Boyle Heights and Watts – a site in the city of New Orleans, and one
        in Aurora, Colorado. In the summer of 2016, we will open our ninth
        site in Denver.
